# Challenges 
- Did not know how to make scrapy to follow links within pages
    - Decided to use two different spiders to solve the issue
- Kept on forgetting the different scrapy cli
    - Decided to create file named scrapy that contains a mini-documentation for the framework to help make the project run smoother
- The extracted links and recipes did not equal to each other
    - Created Validation.py to find out why they were not equal

# Recommandations:
1. Use a more varied data source
2. I should have defined the business problem prior to labelling
3. I preprocessed the data too much, I should have only removed trailing periods, and question marks
4. Implementation of a logging and feedback aspect of the api
