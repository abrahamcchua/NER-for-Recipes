Scraped the links to the recipes:
- Working on a way to scrape to the end of the cookbook automatically

12/16/2022 - 20:47
(Bug-Fix)
Fixed the structure of the output file to become more logical.
The scraper will now skip non-recipe links

12/17/2022 - 18:08
(Update)
Finished parsing the raw data to be used for the Machine Learning Project.
Will start to label the data for the NER project.


12/19/2022 -16:48
(Update)
Added preprocessing to the unlabelled NER dataset


12/19/2022 -15:26
(Update)
Renamed folder to DataParser, also removed '-' from the preprocessing process.


1/14/2023 - 18:28
(Update)
Finished labelling and preprocessing the raw data.
- to-change.txt provided rules to help the labelling process become 
more  constant, it also contains a number of changes and insights that 
was gained from the labelling period. It can be used to help in 
relabeling the data.
- The raw labelled data is stored withint Labelled-data.json
- The preprocessed dataset is found in dataset.csv
- The logic used to preprocess the data can be found in pre-processor.py


1/17/2023 - 21:02
(Update)
Finished training the NER Model:
- The model was trained on google collab, to make the training process faster
- Most values for the Precision, Recall, F1_Score of the model on different entities were above 0.80
- Only value that was below 0.8 was the recall for measurement
- The model making an inference can be seen in Inference.ipynb


1/19/2023 - 20:53
(Refactoring and Documentation)
Retrained the model with 20 epochs and updated the different relevant json files
Finished refactoring and placing documentation in:
- Architecture_NER_deeplearning.ipynb
- Inference.ipynb
Need to finish refactoring and placing documentations in the DataParser folder and NER/Preprocessing


1/20/2023 - 18:26
(Refactoring and Documentation)
Finished placing documentations to the different python files
Also renamed NER/Preprocessing/pre-processor.py to preprocessor.py
Updated the scrapy file to indicate the different cli commands used to web parse.
