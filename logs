Scraped the links to the recipes:
- Working on a way to scrape to the end of the cookbook automatically

12/16/2022 - 20:47
(Bug-Fix)
Fixed the structure of the output file to become more logical.
The scraper will now skip non-recipe links

(Update)
Finished parsing the raw data to be used for the Machine Learning Project.
Will start to label the data for the NER project.

(Update)
Added preprocessing to the unlabelled NER dataset


12/19/2022 -15:26
(Update)
Renamed folder to DataParser, also removed '-' from the preprocessing process.

(Update)
Finished labelling and preprocessing the raw data.
- to-change.txt provided rules to help the labelling process become 
more  constant, it also contains a number of changes and insights that 
was gained from the labelling period. It can be used to help in 
relabeling the data.
- The raw labelled data is stored withint Labelled-data.json
- The preprocessed dataset is found in dataset.csv
- The logic used to preprocess the data can be found in pre-processor.py

(Update)
Finished training the NER Model:
- The model was trained on google collab, to make the training process faster
- Most values for the Precision, Recall, F1_Score of the model on different entities were above 0.80
- Only value that was below 0.8 was the recall for measurement
- The model making an inference can be seen in Inference.ipynb
